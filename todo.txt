- COMBO DETECTION
- SCORING
- LEVELS

ARE - entry delay 
line clear delay
-> when blocks r attempted to be pushed up into line -1  (from garbage or whatever) -> game over ('top out' condition)
basically to prevent out of index error lmao, but also can just disable this and just delete rows when they are pushed up from line 0
