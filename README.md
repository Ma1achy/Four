"A Python based stacker game in the same genre as Tetris!"

I am writing this in my free time as a project to learn some game development and software development basics :)
The Tetris engine is roughly 50% complete, I hope to eventually be able to use it in fututre planned machine learning project! 

Currently a bare bones recreation of the webgame [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io/) in Python.
My attempt at making the game look similar to TETR.IO is mainly for the sake of completness (and fun).
